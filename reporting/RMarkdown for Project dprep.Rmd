# The Nostalgia Effect: How Release Year and Genre Shape IMDb Movie Ratings Over Time

https://github.com/course-dprep/team-project-spring-2025-team-4

## Introduction 
This project aims to explore how nostalgia influences IMDb movie ratings by analyzing the relationship between a film’s release year and audience perception, with genre as a moderating factor. As nostalgia increasingly shapes consumer preferences, understanding its impact on movie reception can reveal biases in ratings and cultural memory effects. This study provides insights into how audiences evaluate films over time, helping industry professionals leverage nostalgia in content creation, marketing, and distribution strategies.

## Motivation
In today’s entertainment industry, maximizing audience engagement and profitability is crucial, and nostalgia has been identified as a key factor influencing movie reception (Ulker-Demirel et al., 2018). While studies have explored whether nostalgia motivates audiences to watch remakes and reunions (Tetik & Türkelı, 2023) or influences viewer engagement (Andrade, 2023), little research has examined how nostalgia manifests in IMDb user ratings and whether it directly impacts the perceived quality of a movie. From an academic perspective, this study contributes to film studies, behavioral psychology, and consumer research by empirically analyzing rating patterns over time and assessing whether nostalgia bias or selective survival bias systematically influence IMDb ratings. Additionally, it examines how factors such as genre interact with this relationship, offering a deeper understanding of audience preferences and cultural memory in film evaluation.

From a real-world and managerial standpoint, this research has direct implications for film studios, streaming platforms, and marketers in shaping their content strategies. If older films receive higher ratings due to nostalgia rather than objective quality, this insight could influence decisions on which films to remake, re-release, or highlight in marketing campaigns. Streaming platforms can refine their recommendation algorithms by accounting for nostalgia-driven biases, improving user engagement and retention. Additionally, movie studios could leverage these findings to predict the potential success of sequels and franchise revivals, ensuring they appeal to audiences who value nostalgic elements. Understanding how genre moderates this effect also allows industry professionals to tailor their approach depending on whether certain film types (e.g., sci-fi, drama, or animation) are more influenced by nostalgia than others. Ultimately, this study provides a data-driven framework for maximizing audience appeal, optimizing content distribution, and making strategic investment decisions in the evolving film industry.


## Research Question
To what extent is (i)  IMDb movie user rating influenced by the (ii) movie released year? And to what extent does (iii) movie genre influence this relationship?

## Data

For this study, we used publicly available datasets from IMDb’s non-commercial dataset repository (IMDb Non-Commercial Datasets). 
Link to the website: https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/ 

Specifically, we utilized two key datasets: 
title.ratings.tsv.gz – Provides IMDb user ratings, including: 
•⁠  ⁠Average Rating (DV) from the averageRating field. 
•⁠  ⁠Number of Votes from the numVotes field. 

title.basics.tsv.gz – Contains movie metadata, including: 
*Release Year (IV) from the startYear field. 
*Genre (Moderator Variable) from the genres field. 
*Country (Control Variable - U.S.), filtered to include only U.S. releases. 

| Variable Name  | Description / Operationalization |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| `averageRating` | Dependent Variable (DV). IMDb user rating on a 0–10 scale. |
| `numVotes` | Number of votes submitted for the title (additional metric). |
| `startYear` | Independent Variable (IV). Year the title was first released. |
| `genres` | Moderator Variable. Primary genres listed for the title. |
| `country` | Control Variable. Filtered for U.S. releases if specified. |

Why IMDb? 
IMDb provides a high-quality dataset for analyzing trends in movie ratings over time, the influence of genre, and country-specific variations. The structured dataset ensures a methodologically sound approach for studying how IMDb user ratings evolve with release year and genre differences.

For this study, the current amount of observations is 743629 in the sample.

For data preparation, we conducted the project in following steps: 
The first step in our workflow was to upload or retrieve the IMDb datasets—title.basics.tsv.gz and title.ratings.tsv.gz—directly from the public repository. We automated the process using R scripts that handle downloads and extraction, ensuring reproducibility and minimizing errors from manual handling. During this stage, we also selected the essential variables to address our research questions, focusing on startYear (hypothesized to capture nostalgic sentiment over time), averageRating (our primary dependent variable), numVotes (to gauge popularity), and genres (to investigate genre-specific moderating effects). We chose these variables based on the academic premise that nostalgia may bias audience perceptions of film quality and that certain genres might be more susceptible to this phenomenon.

Next, we cleaned the raw data by removing missing values (e.g., titles with no valid release year or rating), filtering out future-dated entries, and converting relevant fields to appropriate data types (e.g., numeric). This step ensured that our dataset accurately represented actual releases and legitimate user feedback, thus strengthening the validity of our analysis. We then merged the cleaned tables on their unique identifier (tconst) to consolidate information on both film characteristics and user ratings in a single dataset. Additionally, we engineered new variables—for instance, an isReleased indicator to exclude unreleased titles and a career_category variable in related scripts—to capture theoretically meaningful distinctions in our data. By structuring the workflow around uploading, choosing variables, cleaning, and merging, we established a robust, code-driven pipeline that upholds academic rigor, supports our nostalgia-focused hypotheses, and provides clear, actionable insights for both scholarly and managerial audiences.
